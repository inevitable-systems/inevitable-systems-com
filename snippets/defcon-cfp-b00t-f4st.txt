- Services should not violate user privacy or security.
Want to play? Hackers have always done well with limited resources, challenging legal frameworks,
and restricted access to information. If you you are thinking of giving a talk, build a demo or
organize a workshop here are some ideas:
- How do we share information in a secure and anonymous fashion?
- How do we backup or preserve data that may disappear in the future, beyond sending it to
archive.org?
- Create tools that help people migrate from large enshitified platforms to distributed Fediverse ones
- Help make alternative services more robust and secure - Fuzz them, reverse them, hunt for bugs,
build stronger!
- Curate libraries of data and share how you design your management tools
- The laws around data are changing, where do we host our VMs and data for maximum personal
freedom?
Yes, I prefer to be anonymous
No, including my name is fine
By default the review board will see your name, company you work at, and bio, unless you
select otherwise. The review board is never given your contact information, email, or phone
numbers regardless of anonymity.
You are responsible for stripping out any other personally identifiable information out of your
supporting files, your outline, or additional responses. The review board will not be held
responsible for figuring out who you are, if you leave your name(s) in the slide deck you send

ABSTRACT
Your abstract will be used for the website and printed materials. Summarize what your
presentation will cover. Attendees will read this to get an idea of what they should know before
your presentation, and what they will learn after. Use this to inform attendees about how
technical your talk is, what tools will be used, what materials to read in advance to get the most
out of your presentation. This abstract is the primary way people will be drawn to your session,
but should not give them the entire content of the talk. We request you keep your abstract well
over 140 characters, but at or under the 1337 maximum.
(not to exceed 1337 characters)
This will be published online if your talk is accepted.
41. Presentation Abstract *
Today’s CI/CD runners are built on dangerous assumptions: that containers clean themselves, that VMs forget their past, and that IP addresses prove trust. They don’t.

In this talk, we introduce Popcorn™ Runners — radically minimal, cryptographically signed substrates for CI/CD workloads. Every runner boots an immutable signed (kernel and rootfs), binds to a signed mTLS role at power-on, and enforces trust without relying on IPs, mutable infra, or runtime patching.

Immutable by design. Artifact-free. Observability anchored outside the runner via role-bound mTLS.

Live demo: Cold-boot to payload execution under 1 second (plus disk transfer time of CI config), with no lingering attack surface or supply chain drift.

You are what you boot. Your privileges are what you’re signed for.

This is the most important section on the application. The minimum char count on an
outline should be no less than 350. The max limitation in Microsoft forms is 4000 if
your outline exceeds that please email it to talks@defcon.org with the title of your
talk submission in the email.
You must provide a detailed outline containing the main points and navigation through your talk
- show how you intend to begin, where you intend to lead the audience and how you plan to get
there. Your outline should be in simple text. Please do not submit slides, Docs, or PDFs as an
outline.
If you are submitting a panel, it’s encouraged to list what each panel member will contribute to
on the outline, as well as the estimated time budgeted for those bullet points. The review board
likes submissions that include references to prior works and research you used in developing
your presentation. The more detailed your outline then the better we are able to review your
presentation against other submissions (and the higher chance you have of being accepted).

44. Detailed Outline: *
Introduction (~2 min)
• Frame the problem: Modern CI/CD infrastructure is built on
dangerous trust assumptions: container resets, VM reboots, DHCP-assigned IPs.
• Quick examples of real-world CI/CD compromises due to drift, artifact
residue, and IP spoofing attacks (e.g., Tesla Autopilot GitHub repo hack 2020;
SolarWinds CI compromise references).
• Introduce Popcorn™ Runners: a new primitive based on immutable,
signed boot layers and role-bound mTLS identity.

• “Lessons from the SolarWinds Attack” — CISA Report, 2021
• “CI/CD Pipelines as Critical Attack Surfaces” — OWASP SAMM, 2022
⸻
Trust Assumptions in Traditional CI/CD (~5 min)
• Explain container/VM reuse and why resets are insufficient (residue,
hidden state).
• Highlight DHCP/IP reuse attacks in Kubernetes and cloud CI (e.g.,
pod churn leakage).
• Explain why metadata services, ephemeral disk wipes, and dynamic
network leases are not cryptographic trust anchors.
Reference:
• “Poisoned Pods: IP and DNS Reuse in Kubernetes” — Black Hat USA
2020
⸻
Immutable Boot: Signed Kernel + RootFS (~7 min)
• Define what “immutable signed (kernel and rootfs)” means.
• Walk through how Popcorn images are built and sealed before
deployment (no mutable boot paths, no mutable runtime injection points).
• How every Popcorn runner starts clean: sealed boot, verified
signature, runtime read-only lock.
• Comparison against ephemeral container images (OCI), ephemeral
VMs (cloud-init), and why they still allow mutation at runtime.
Reference:
• “Immutable Infrastructure and Zero-Drift Systems” — ThoughtWorks
Tech Radar, 2021
⸻
Identity: mTLS Roles at Boot (~7 min)
• Explain role-based mTLS: identity is baked at boot, cryptographically
verified before the runner speaks to any external system.
• How this eliminates IP-based trust, metadata identity spoofing, and
lateral movement attacks.
• Live flowchart: Runner boots → signs → presents mTLS cert →
external systems audit and log role-bound connection.

Observability Outside the Runner (~5 min)
• Discuss how mTLS certificates allow external systems to
independently verify what identity performed which action.
• Runner compromise cannot falsify audit logs.
• Bonus: Potential for Merkle tree hashing of audit streams for tamperproof
logging.
Reference:
• “BeyondCorp: A New Approach to Enterprise Security” — Google

⸻
Live Demo (~8 min)
• Show cold boot of a Popcorn Runner:
• Boot an immutable signed kernel+rootfs
• Present mTLS role cert immediately at boot
• Complete CI job handshake in under 1 second (plus disk transfer time
of CI config).
Hacker History and Why DEF CON?
Note: This is your opportunity to directly address the DEF CON review board as to why
you think your talk is good for our hacker con. More and more we are seeing submissions
that are well suited for cyber security industry conferences, developer conferences, or local meetups
but may not align with the board's view of the DEF CON spirit. The bumper sticker "Keep Infosec
out of Hacking" comes to mind.
We get many great submissions but they aren't always aimed at the 30,000 hackers at our con. This
frequently results in the review board saying "Unfortunately, this is not a DEF CON talk". DEF CON
is a hacking con, so how does your content fit in to that culture, spirit, and subject matter?
DEF CON 33 Call for Papers 4/29/25, 04:58

There is a minimum character count to encourage you to consider these questions
seriously. If you absolutely cannot meet that number and it's discouraging you from submitting
your application, don't fret; just enter the letter X until you meet the minimum.
Why DEF CON? Why is this a hacker talk? Why does it belong here?
45. Why DEF CON? *
This is a hacker talk because it attacks core trust assumptions built into modern
CI/CD infrastructure — assumptions that leave pipelines vulnerable to artifact
drift, supply chain injection, IP reuse, and impersonation attacks. Popcorn
Runners are designed to eliminate these blind spots with immutable boot and
mTLS role identity, returning control to the operator. DEF CON is about tearing
down fragile systems and rebuilding stronger ones — and this talk lives at that
What do you bring to the table, how will you or your presentation(s) contribute a new
perspective to the content at DEF CON? (Please answer for each speaker and/or panel
members.)
46. Speaker Perspectives *
I’ve spent decades building, breaking, and hardening critical systems at every
layer — from mainframes to mobile, from storage fabric to financial transaction
security. My experience rewriting filesystem guts (CXFS), building verifiable
Unicode parsers, and deploying immutable kernels gives me a deeply pragmatic
view of how fragile real-world trust models are. This talk brings practical,
deployable zero-trust methods to one of the most critical attack surfaces hackers
47. What else about you or this talk do you want us to know?
I’m bringing a working proof-of-concept and a real-world demo. Not a pitch, not
a theory, but a system that boots, signs, runs, and tears itself down without drift

community with ideas and primitives they can steal, extend, and weaponize for
their own infrastructure.

Are there any other special equipment needs that you will require to successfully present your
talk?
Please note: DEF CON requires presenters to deliver their slides and content via a DEF CON
provided laptop on stage. Exceptions can be made with justification.
Request permission to use personal laptop for live demo. Demo involves signed
kernel boot processes, immutable filesystems, and mTLS identity presentation
not reproducible via DEFCON-provided Windows laptops. If personal hardware is
not permitted, I will revert to a pre-recorded video backup and talk over the
demo footage.
Supporting Files
Additional supporting materials such as code, white papers, proof of concept, etc., can be sent
along with your submission. You can email them to talks@defcon.org when you're ready.
Additional files that may help in the selection process should be included. We are not asking for a
complete presentation for this initial submission. Full slides will only be required if your presentation
is accepted.
It is the submitter's responsibility to remove any unwanted PII from any attached slides, white
papers, or supporting materials, and to appropriately sanitize any metadata in the provided content.

Terms of Speaking Remuneration
Regardless of honorarium choice, each accepted speaker will receive a free badge for admission
into DEF CON valid from Thursday August 7th to Sunday August 10th. In rare cases of large panels,
free entry badges may be limited in number.
1) DEF CON will provide 4 nights hotel per accepted presentation for the primary speaker only. The
hotel will be at the DEF CON Venue properties, and of DEF CON’s choosing. I understand I will need
to confirm my hotel nights and submit my preferences by the date listed in my official acceptance
letter. I understand that I will be responsible for my own travel expenses, unless prior approval is
made with special exception. Upon your talk acceptance you will get a separate email regarding
your lodging arrangements.
2) I understand that DEF CON will issue one $300 payment per presentation to the primary speaker
only. Payment will be made in the form of company check. I may choose to waive my $300
honorarium in exchange for 3 DEF CON Human badges, received at the start of the conference. I
may also choose to donate my honorarium to charity. If you are the primary speaker on two or
more talks, you are entitled to honorarium for each talk, but you will still receive only one
"speaker's badge". Giving two talks? 1 speaker's badge, and you can select 6 human badges or
$600 honorarium, or 3 badges and $300 honorarium.
3) I understand that I may receive payment on-site at the conference. If selecting the $300
payment as my honorarium, I must provide a valid name and postal mail address so that the
payment may be mailed. In some rare cases, I may be required to complete a W8 (Non-U.S.
Citizen) or W9 (U.S. Citizen) before payment is issued.
4) I understand that I will be paid within 30 days from the end of the conference, after I have

completed my presentation. I understand that should my talk be determined to be unsuitable (e.g.
a vendor or sales pitch, a talk on the keeping of goats, etc.) after I have presented, that I will not
receive an honorarium.

Community & Code of Conduct Commitment
DEF CON is a community event and your applications approval means we are endorsing you as the
type of people we want to include, promote, and whom belong within the DEF CON community.
When someone at DEF CON behaves poorly they should be held accountable, otherwise we both
look bad.
When DEF CON pays for fines or property damages it harms the community by reducing what DEF
CON can contribute in support of new ideas, events and activities. I understand that DEF CON
reserves the right to invoice an itemized bill, when costs occur due (but not limited to) the
following: Damage or destruction of property. Fines and fees billed to DEF CON for any noncompliance
to the requests from the venue staff or contracted rules. Fees for bringing in outside
food and drink, damages to the space or property you were assigned, etc.
I also understand that my presentation must not violate the required accountability
within the DEF CON community as outlined in our Code of Conduct.

in interviewing you about your talk. You would only be contacted by a DEF CON press liaison, in

Important things to consider after your talk is submitted
Some things to note about sharing your content before and after acceptance: DEF CON has in the
past, and will in the future, pull submissions after they’ve been accepted. We hate doing this, and
I’m sure you would hate this as well. Things that could cause us to rescind your acceptance are:
1. Finding out there was an important omission in your submission. For example, if you
already gave a version of your talk that is significantly the same, but failed to tell us about it.
2. Submitting to a talk after you submit to DEF CON and then give the talk before DEF
CON. While you might have been honest when you said that you didn't submit to other conferences

when you filled out the CFP, the impact on the conference is the same - the material isn't new.
Sometimes we do accept talks that have been given in some form or another, but generally we
want original material.
3. Releasing the key content of your talk in other mediums before DEF CON; blog posts,
interviews, etc. The end result is that people will potentially know that they already have the
information you are going to give in your speech - so why would they go to it? So, please don’t spill
the beans…let the cat out of the bag…sink ships…ruin the surprise, etc. If you have any questions
about those three issues, please ask.
