When:  August 7th- 10th, 2025
How: Complete this DEF CON 33 Call for Papers Form. Email additional files or supporting documents to talks at defcon dot org.
Deadline: Call for Papers will close on May 01, 2025

Speaking Formats are: 20 minutes, 45 minutes, 105 minutes (Two slots back to back).

The theme for DEF CON 33 is ‘Access Everywhere’:
- Services should be usable no matter who you are.
- Services should be accessible no matter where you are.
- Services should not violate user privacy or security.

Want to play? Hackers have always done well with limited resources, challenging legal frameworks, and restricted access to information. If you you are thinking of giving a talk, build a demo or organize a workshop here are some ideas:

- How do we share information in a secure and anonymous fashion?
- How do we backup or preserve data that may disappear in the future, beyond sending it to archive.org?
- Create tools that help people migrate from large enshitified platforms to distributed Fediverse ones
- Help make alternative services more robust and secure - Fuzz them, reverse them, hunt for bugs, build stronger!
- Curate libraries of data and share how you design your management tools
- The laws around data are changing, where do we host our VMs and data for maximum personal freedom?

1.Submit anonymously?
By default the review board will see your name, company you work at, and bio, unless you select otherwise. The review board is never given your contact information, email, or phone numbers regardless of anonymity.

You are responsible for stripping out any other personally identifiable information out of your supporting files, your outline, or additional responses. The review board will not be held responsible for figuring out who you are, if you leave your name(s) in the slide deck you send us.

Yes, I prefer to be anonymous

No, including my name is fine
2.Are you submitting for the DEF CON Policy Track? Is this a Policy themed talk?
The DEF CON Policy dept wishes to invite those interested to submit policy talks via the CFP board. This means your talk will be considered for both main tracks and the DEF CON policy track in the Policy Village.
DEF CON welcomes policymakers and technology professionals to join Policy@DEF CON and participate with our community of knowledgeable experts. We need to work together.

Over the past 30 years the DEF CON community, has evolved and grown along with the cyber domain. We understand that creating a safer digital society requires collaboration between security and policy experts. DEF CON provides a space for representatives of all areas of security to come together to educate and engage each other.

Tech policy is being written as we speak and we believe including diverse expert voices will improve outcomes across the policy-technology spectrum by bridging the gap between technical and policy practitioners. Senior government officials, policy experts, nonprofit and the private sector, security researchers, hackers, academics and technologists from around the world all come together at Policy @ DEF CON.

A write up for this years policy CFP and talks FAQ can be found here:  https://defcon.org/policy/


Yes, this is a policy talk.

No, I'm only interested in the main talk tracks.

DETAILED OUTLINE
44.Detailed Outline:
This is the most important section on the application. The minimum char count on an outline should be no less than 350. The max limitation in Microsoft forms is 4000 if your outline exceeds that please email it to talks@defcon.org with the title of your talk submission in the email.

You must provide a detailed outline containing the main points and navigation through your talk - show how you intend to begin, where you intend to lead the audience and how you plan to get there. Your outline should be in simple text. Please do not submit slides, Docs, or PDFs as an outline.

If you are submitting a panel, it’s encouraged to list what each panel member will contribute to on the outline, as well as the estimated time budgeted for those bullet points. The review board likes submissions that include references to prior works and research you used in developing your presentation. The more detailed your outline then the better we are able to review your presentation against other submissions (and the higher chance you have of being accepted).

Good Outlines are discussed here:

Hacker History and Why DEF CON?
Note: This is your opportunity to directly address the DEF CON review board as to why you think your talk is good for our hacker con. More and more we are seeing submissions that are well suited for cyber security industry conferences, developer conferences, or local meetups but may not align with the board's view of the DEF CON spirit. The bumper sticker "Keep Infosec out of Hacking" comes to mind.

We get many great submissions but they aren't always aimed at the 30,000 hackers at our con. This frequently results in the review board saying "Unfortunately, this is not a DEF CON talk". DEF CON is a hacking con, so how does your content fit in to that culture, spirit, and subject matter?

There is a minimum character count to encourage you to consider these questions seriously. If you absolutely cannot meet that number and it's discouraging you from submitting your application, don't fret; just enter the letter X until you meet the minimum.
45.Why DEF CON?
Why DEF CON? Why is this a hacker talk? Why does it belong here?

46.Speaker Perspectives
What do you bring to the table, how will you or your presentation(s) contribute a new perspective to the content at DEF CON? (Please answer for each speaker and/or panel members.)

47.What else about you or this talk do you want us to know?

Community & Code of Conduct Commitment
DEF CON is a community event and your applications approval means we are endorsing you as the type of people we want to include, promote, and whom belong within the DEF CON community. When someone at DEF CON behaves poorly they should be held accountable, otherwise we both look bad.

When DEF CON pays for fines or property damages it harms the community by reducing what DEF CON can contribute in support of new ideas, events and activities. I understand that DEF CON reserves the right to invoice an itemized bill, when costs occur due (but not limited to) the following: Damage or destruction of property. Fines and fees billed to DEF CON for any non-compliance to the requests from the venue staff or contracted rules. Fees for bringing in outside food and drink, damages to the space or property you were assigned, etc.

I also understand that my presentation must not violate the required accountability within the DEF CON community as outlined in our Code of Conduct.

What and Where to post online, Spoiler Alert! Don't ruin your chances...

Important things to consider after your talk is submitted

Some things to note about sharing your content before and after acceptance: DEF CON has in the past, and will in the future, pull submissions after they’ve been accepted. We hate doing this, and I’m sure you would hate this as well. Things that could cause us to rescind your acceptance are:

1. Finding out there was an important omission in your submission. For example, if you already gave a version of your talk that is significantly the same, but failed to tell us about it.

2. Submitting to a talk after you submit to DEF CON and then give the talk before DEF CON. While you might have been honest when you said that you didn't submit to other conferences when you filled out the CFP, the impact on the conference is the same - the material isn't new. Sometimes we do accept talks that have been given in some form or another, but generally we want original material.

3. Releasing the key content of your talk in other mediums before DEF CON; blog posts, interviews, etc. The end result is that people will potentially know that they already have the information you are going to give in your speech - so why would they go to it? So, please don’t spill the beans…let the cat out of the bag…sink ships…ruin the surprise, etc. If you have any questions about those three issues, please ask.

DEF CON online:
When you toot/skeet/etc, post on facebook, or otherwise use social media regarding DEF CON 33, please tag us or use the hashtag #DEFCON33. Tagging us in our social media can increase the chances we will see it, and give your toot/skeet/post a better chance of us sharing it. Not to mention, con attendees follow the #DEFCON and #DEFCON33 tags as well. Please join us on Mastodon (https://defcon.social).

How: Complete this DEF CON 33 Call for Papers Form. Email additional files or supporting documents to talks at defcon dot org.
Deadline: Call for Papers will close on May 01, 2025

Speaking Formats are: 20 minutes, 45 minutes, 105 minutes (Two slots back to back).

The theme for DEF CON 33 is ‘Access Everywhere’:
- Services should be usable no matter who you are.
- Services should be accessible no matter where you are.
- Services should not violate user privacy or security.

Want to play? Hackers have always done well with limited resources, challenging legal frameworks, and restricted access to information. If you you are thinking of giving a talk, build a demo or organize a workshop here are some ideas:

- How do we share information in a secure and anonymous fashion?
- How do we backup or preserve data that may disappear in the future, beyond sending it to archive.org?
- Create tools that help people migrate from large enshitified platforms to distributed Fediverse ones
- Help make alternative services more robust and secure - Fuzz them, reverse them, hunt for bugs, build stronger!
- Curate libraries of data and share how you design your management tools
- The laws around data are changing, where do we host our VMs and data for maximum personal freedom?

1.Submit anonymously?
By default the review board will see your name, company you work at, and bio, unless you select otherwise. The review board is never given your contact information, email, or phone numbers regardless of anonymity.

You are responsible for stripping out any other personally identifiable information out of your supporting files, your outline, or additional responses. The review board will not be held responsible for figuring out who you are, if you leave your name(s) in the slide deck you send us.

Yes, I prefer to be anonymous

No, including my name is fine
2.Are you submitting for the DEF CON Policy Track? Is this a Policy themed talk?
The DEF CON Policy dept wishes to invite those interested to submit policy talks via the CFP board. This means your talk will be considered for both main tracks and the DEF CON policy track in the Policy Village.
DEF CON welcomes policymakers and technology professionals to join Policy@DEF CON and participate with our community of knowledgeable experts. We need to work together.

Over the past 30 years the DEF CON community, has evolved and grown along with the cyber domain. We understand that creating a safer digital society requires collaboration between security and policy experts. DEF CON provides a space for representatives of all areas of security to come together to educate and engage each other.

Tech policy is being written as we speak and we believe including diverse expert voices will improve outcomes across the policy-technology spectrum by bridging the gap between technical and policy practitioners. Senior government officials, policy experts, nonprofit and the private sector, security researchers, hackers, academics and technologists from around the world all come together at Policy @ DEF CON.

A write up for this years policy CFP and talks FAQ can be found here:  https://defcon.org/policy/


Yes, this is a policy talk.

No, I'm only interested in the main talk tracks.

Use this to inform attendees about how technical your talk is, what tools will be used, what materials to read in advance to get the most out of your presentation. This abstract is the primary way people will be drawn to your session, but should not give them the entire content of the talk. We request you keep your abstract well over 140 characters, but at or under the 1337 maximum.

(not to exceed 1337 characters)

This will be published online if your talk is accepted.

REFERENCES

Please remember to credit prior works and acknowledge others. References will be posted online with your talk information.

This will be published online if your talk is accepted.

43.Confidential References
If there are references that you would like to make available to the CFP board but would not like for them to be published, you may list them here.

DETAILED OUTLINE
44.Detailed Outline:
This is the most important section on the application. The minimum char count on an outline should be no less than 350. The max limitation in Microsoft forms is 4000 if your outline exceeds that please email it to talks@defcon.org with the title of your talk submission in the email.

You must provide a detailed outline containing the main points and navigation through your talk - show how you intend to begin, where you intend to lead the audience and how you plan to get there. Your outline should be in simple text. Please do not submit slides, Docs, or PDFs as an outline.

If you are submitting a panel, it’s encouraged to list what each panel member will contribute to on the outline, as well as the estimated time budgeted for those bullet points. The review board likes submissions that include references to prior works and research you used in developing your presentation. The more detailed your outline then the better we are able to review your presentation against other submissions (and the higher chance you have of being accepted).

Good Outlines are discussed here:
https://writingprocess.mit.edu/process/step-2-plan-and-organize/creating-detailed-outline
https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-speakerscorner.html#nikita-cfp
https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-speakerscorner.html#leah-cfp-process

BAD outlines look like these:
i. intro
ii.something
iii. something else
iv. conclusion
v. q&a

Please indicate below if you intend to email us your outline, we will not submit your application to the review board until your outline is received.

Hacker History and Why DEF CON?
Note: This is your opportunity to directly address the DEF CON review board as to why you think your talk is good for our hacker con. More and more we are seeing submissions that are well suited for cyber security industry conferences, developer conferences, or local meetups but may not align with the board's view of the DEF CON spirit. The bumper sticker "Keep Infosec out of Hacking" comes to mind.

We get many great submissions but they aren't always aimed at the 30,000 hackers at our con. This frequently results in the review board saying "Unfortunately, this is not a DEF CON talk". DEF CON is a hacking con, so how does your content fit in to that culture, spirit, and subject matter?

There is a minimum character count to encourage you to consider these questions seriously. If you absolutely cannot meet that number and it's discouraging you from submitting your application, don't fret; just enter the letter X until you meet the minimum.
45.Why DEF CON?
Why DEF CON? Why is this a hacker talk? Why does it belong here?

46.Speaker Perspectives
What do you bring to the table, how will you or your presentation(s) contribute a new perspective to the content at DEF CON? (Please answer for each speaker and/or panel members.)

47.What else about you or this talk do you want us to know?

SCHEDULING AND EQUIPMENT REQUIREMENTS
DEF CON 33 will be held August 7th- 10th, 2025,  you may be asked to present Thursday - Sunday, please plan accordingly as requests to speak on specific days may not be possible.
48.Specific Availability
Is there a specific day or time by which you must present?

No = I have no specific availability requirements

Yes = I have specific availability requirements

Maybe = I have submitted or plan to submit in response to a call for content from another DEF CON department or creator, and that might cause a conflict. My schedule may require coordination.

No

Yes

Maybe
49. Projector Feeds
Will you require more than 1 projector feed? Yes or No. If yes, please specify how many and why.

50.Special Equipment
Are there any other special equipment needs that you will require to successfully present your talk?

Please note: DEF CON requires presenters to deliver their slides and content via a DEF CON provided laptop on stage. Exceptions can be made with justification.

Supporting Files
Additional supporting materials such as code, white papers, proof of concept, etc., can be sent along with your submission.  You can email them to talks@defcon.org when you're ready.  Additional files that may help in the selection process should be included. We are not asking for a complete presentation for this initial submission. Full slides will only be required if your presentation is accepted.

It is the submitter's responsibility to remove any unwanted PII from any attached slides, white papers, or supporting materials, and to appropriately sanitize any metadata in the provided content.

Please include the title of your presentation as the subject line of your email. You should receive email confirmation within 3 business days. If you do not, please reach out again to inquire.

1) DEF CON will provide 4 nights hotel per accepted presentation for the primary speaker only. The hotel will be at the DEF CON Venue properties, and of DEF CON’s choosing.

Community & Code of Conduct Commitment
DEF CON is a community event and your applications approval means we are endorsing you as the type of people we want to include, promote, and whom belong within the DEF CON community. When someone at DEF CON behaves poorly they should be held accountable, otherwise we both look bad.

When DEF CON pays for fines or property damages it harms the community by reducing what DEF CON can contribute in support of new ideas, events and activities. I understand that DEF CON reserves the right to invoice an itemized bill, when costs occur due (but not limited to) the following: Damage or destruction of property. Fines and fees billed to DEF CON for any non-compliance to the requests from the venue staff or contracted rules. Fees for bringing in outside food and drink, damages to the space or property you were assigned, etc.

I also understand that my presentation must not violate the required accountability within the DEF CON community as outlined in our Code of Conduct.
https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-code-of-conduct.html
53.As detailed above, I have read and agree to the Community & Code of Conduct Commitment.

Yes

No

You would only be contacted by a DEF CON press liaison, in order to arrange interviews with the media, your contact information will not be given to third parties without your consent. Sometimes, we may even recommend an interview due to the excitement of your talk, to promote you.

What and Where to post online, Spoiler Alert! Don't ruin your chances...

Important things to consider after your talk is submitted

Some things to note about sharing your content before and after acceptance: DEF CON has in the past, and will in the future, pull submissions after they’ve been accepted. We hate doing this, and I’m sure you would hate this as well. Things that could cause us to rescind your acceptance are:

1. Finding out there was an important omission in your submission. For example, if you already gave a version of your talk that is significantly the same, but failed to tell us about it.

2. Submitting to a talk after you submit to DEF CON and then give the talk before DEF CON. While you might have been honest when you said that you didn't submit to other conferences when you filled out the CFP, the impact on the conference is the same - the material isn't new. Sometimes we do accept talks that have been given in some form or another, but generally we want original material.

3. Releasing the key content of your talk in other mediums before DEF CON; blog posts, interviews, etc. The end result is that people will potentially know that they already have the information you are going to give in your speech - so why would they go to it? So, please don’t spill the beans…let the cat out of the bag…sink ships…ruin the surprise, etc. If you have any questions about those three issues, please ask.

DEF CON online:

💀 DEFCON — What Are You Now?

Once, DEFCON was cash at the door, plaintext CFPs, honor among hackers.

Now it’s Microsoft Forms, GitHub SSO, mandatory metadata, and hardsold passcodes.

Submit your deepest trustless ideas — through centralized, surveilled platforms.
Authenticate yourself — to the same corporations you’re trying to defend against.

DEFCON used to be the counterculture.
Now it rents it.

Privacy is not a checkbox.
Freedom is not a badge scan.
Trust is not a cloud account.

DEFCON, if you want to remain what you once were: Fight, or fade.

#DEFCON33 #hacking #privacy #freedom
