🧨 Errors. Amplified. At Scale.
Nothing scarier.

In 2017, I triggered 5,000 CI jobs by accident — and helped GitLab fix a bug that could have cost them big.

Today, GitLab still launches thousands of runners per minute — with real cost, risk, and complexity.

SwiftBoot + Popcorn changes the game.
•	🌀 Millisecond microVMs.
•	🔐 Full kernel isolation.
•	📦 No Docker daemon. No leftover state.
•	💵 $0.05 per job. Pay only for what runs.

No hot pool. No cold boot delay. No leaking builds.
Just jobs that launch, run, and disappear — before errors have a chance to spread.
